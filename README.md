// MY FIRST EVER EXCEL PROJECT SO BEAR WITH ME 

Global HR Executive Dashboard (Excel)

* Project Overview

This project involved transforming a raw HR dataset into an interactive, professional-grade dashboard. The goal was to provide HR leaders with a "single pane of glass" view into global workforce metrics, including payroll distribution, headcount demographics, and performance analysis.


* Key Questions Answered:

What is the total annual payroll across the entire organization?

How is the workforce distributed geographically across different countries?

What are the age demographics and average tenure of our employees?

Which departments or job titles are receiving the highest bonuses?


* Tools & Techniques Used

Microsoft Excel: The primary tool for data processing and visualization.

Data Cleaning: Used Power Query (or Filter/Sort/Remove Duplicates) to handle missing values and standardize job titles.

Analysis: Utilized Pivot Tables to aggregate data for 9 distinct KPIs.

Dynamic Interactivity: Integrated Slicers for "Department" and "Country" to allow real-time data drilling.

Data Visualization: Built a suite of charts including Donut charts for gender, Line charts for tenure, and Grouped Bar charts for salary analysis.


* Interactive Features

To use the dashboard, simply use the Control Panel on the right side:

Department Slicer: Click any department (e.g., IT, Sales) to see specific costs and demographics.

Country Slicer: Filter the entire report by geographic location.

Clear Filters: Use the funnel icon in the top right of the slicers to return to the global view.


* Key Insights Discovered

Payroll Concentration: The IT and Engineering departments account for over 35% of total annual payroll.

Tenure Trends: Average tenure shows a significant "plateau" at the 5-year mark, suggesting a need for better mid-career retention strategies.

Regional Disparity: While the United States has the highest headcount, emerging markets in Brazil and China show faster growth in bonus distributions.
